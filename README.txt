TodoGUI is a PyGTK GUI for a todo.txt file. 

It is intended to integrate with todotxt.com

TodoGUI saves to your todo.txt file as it goes to ensure that the current todo.txt file is up to date.

To run TodoGUI download the todogui.py file, open it with a text editor and edit the line that says: 
TDDIR = "/home/user/Dropbox/todo/"
so that it points to the directory where your todo.txt file is stored.

Make sure the file is executable and then run using python.
